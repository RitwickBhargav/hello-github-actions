## Welcome to "Hello World" with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy code right from GitHub. Make code reviews, branch management, and issue triaging work the way we want. This course helps through writing "first action" and using it with a workflow file.
